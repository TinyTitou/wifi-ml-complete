The "add_columns.py" is only used in the beginning to add the missing columns in the .csv files (distance, LoS, antenna orientation) and to generate the "complete_data.csv" file for each folder. You do not need to execute this unless some modification needs to be done to the .csv files.

The "complete_model.ipynb" is the notebook that should be executed and modified for visualizing/analyzing the data, studying the correlations, and fitting and examining the model (Ridge linear regression). All the metrics and features are explained in it.

The data in the folder ACK_counting
 contains the computation where the number of lost frames is done using the information in the ACKs (i.e., the missing frames) called "pktlost_ack", as well as the total number of frames received calculated two ways: what the monitor sees called "nbpkt_monitor" and what is acknowledged by the destination called "nbpkt_ack". These files also contain the number of retries in every interval called "retry".

The corresponding files in the folder "Original computation" are for the same scenarios (note that some original files have been deleted so as to keep the exact same database for both scenarios). Here ce calculate the number of packets lost by looking at what sequence numbers are missing. However this is the computation that does not really distinguish between 1 frame lost and 10 frames lost in a row. 

The "add_columns.py" is only used in the beginning to add the missing columns in the .csv files (distance, LoS, antenna orientation) and to generate the "complete_data.csv" file for each folder. You do not need to execute this unless some modification needs to be done to the .csv files.

The "complete_model.ipynb" is the notebook that should be executed and modified for visualizing/analyzing the data, studying the correlations, and fitting and examining the model (Ridge linear regression).
